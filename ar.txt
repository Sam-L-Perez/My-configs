blar (ah-BLAR) means 'to talk.' Remember that the H is silent. It's like it's not even there.

Estudiar (es-too-dee-AR) means 'to study.' There are several vowels in this one. Remember to say them all, each as a syllable. It's also a cognate, sort of. You can almost see the word 'study' in there.

Tocar (toe-CAR) means 'to play an instrument.' Remember the C in this one is a hard C sound because it is followed by A.

Bailar (bah-ee-LAR) means 'to dance.' Notice the A and I together here. Make sure to hit both of them.

Usar (oo-SAR) means 'to use.' Another cognate!

Practicar (prahk-tee-CAR) means 'to practice.' A definite cognate here. Almost the same word in both languages, when written.

Enseñar (en-sen-i-AR) means 'to teach.'

Dibujar (dee-boo-HAR) means 'to draw.' Let's use alliteration to remember this one. Draw begins with D; dibujar begins with D.

Caminar (cahm-ee-NAR) means 'to walk.'

Cantar (cahn-TAR) means 'to sing.' And have you ever heard of a cantata? That same root is in cantar.

Escuchar (es-koo-CHAR) means 'to listen.'

Comprar (cohm-PRAR) means 'to buy' or 'to shop.'

O,as,a,amos,áis,an.
