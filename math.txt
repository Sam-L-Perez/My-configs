Pre Algebra, introducing Algebra.

Operations in the correct order.

When you are faced with a mathematical expression that has several operations or parentheses, the solution may be affected by the order in which you tackle the operations. For example, take the expression
  4 * 7 - 2

 If we do the multiplication first, we arrive at the following answer:
28 - 2 = 26
 
If instead we begin by subtracting we get:

4 * 5 = 20

In order to avoid confusion and to ensure that everyone always arrives at the same result, mathematicians established a standard order of operations for calculations that involve more than one arithmetic operation. Arithmetic operations should always be carried out in the following order.

1. Simplify the expressions inside parentheses (), brackets [], braces {} and fractions bars.

2. Evaluate all powers

3. Do all multiplications and divisions from left to right

4. Do all addions and subtractions from left to right

EXAMPLE:

Suppose you want to figure out how many hours a person works in twodays assuming that they work 4 hours before lunch and 3 hours after lunch each day. First, work out how many hours the person works each day:

4+3=7

and then multiply that by the number of days the person worked.

7 * 2 = 14

If we were to write this example as one expression, we would need to use parentheses to make sure that people calculate the additon first:

(4+3)*2= 14

2 * [(8-3) + 6 * (2)] - 3

Proper Fractions: 	The numerator is less than the denominator
Examples: 1/3, 3/4, 2/7
  	 

Improper Fractions: 	The numerator is greater than (or equal to) the denominator Examples: 4/3, 11/4, 7/7
  	 
Mixed Fractions: 	A whole number and proper fraction together
Examples: 1 1/3, 2 1/4, 16 2/5

NOTES AND VOCAB:


EXPRESSIONS/EQUATIONS:

the most clear diffrence between a mathmatical expression vs a mathmatical equation is that all  equations include a = sign while no expressions include one.



equation simplified:
an equation is a mathmatical statement that two things are equal 
in it's most basic form it is two expressions seperated by a = .

expression simplified:

Numbers, Symbols and Operators (such as + or x) 

grouped togeather to show the value of something

2+3 is an expression 

the basic formula is (Number, Math operator, Number)

Advanced types of equations/expressions
*To Do*

Variables: A symbol or statement representing a unkown number (y,x)



PEMDAS:
PARENTHESIS
EXPONENTS
MULTIPLICATION
DIVISION
ADDITION
SUBTRACTION.


NEEDED VOCAB:

[EXPONENTS: The exponent of a number says how many times to use the number in a multiplication  (^2) ALSO CALLED either "powers" or "indices"

in 8^2 the "2" says to use 8 twice in a multiplication

so 8^2 = 8x8 = 64

it can also be referred as "8 to the power of 2" or "8 to the second power" or "8 squared"


NEGATIVE EXPONENTS:

A negative exponent means how many times to divide one by the number.

example: 8^-1 = 1/8 = .125

it can be overlapped using two formulas

example 5^-3= 1/5/5/5=.0008

or

example:1/(5*5*5) = 1/5^3 =1/125 = 0.008

RECIPROCAL EXPONENTS AND FRACTIONS: 

reciprocal is akin to flipping the number on it's head

like the reciprocal of 5 is 1/5

or the reciprocal of 1000 or 1000/1 is 1/1000

FRACTIONS:

parts of a whole.
The top number (the Numerator) is the number of parts we have.
The bottom number (the Denominator) is the number of parts the whole is divided into.


Fraction Reciprocal:

for fracions a reciprocal means flipping the numerator and the denominator


like 3/4 becomes 4/3 or 777/1222 turns into 1222/777




Numerator / Denominator:


A numerator is the top number of the fraction and a denominator is the bottom number.


as stated earlier a reciprocal of a fraction is switching the numerator or a denominator




Further Numerator / Denominator shit:


the real tricky reciprocals go like this:

4/12 original equals 1/3
but calling it's reciprocal turns into 12/4 or frankly just 3


the rule of thumb states if you multiply any fraction by it's set reciprocal the final answer will be just 1.




MIXED FRACTIONS:

A whole number and a proper fraction combined (verses a improper fractioon)

examples

2 3/8

7 1/4

1 14/15

21 4/5

the mixed fraction to repeat is a whole number with a fraction marked with a proper numerator and a proper denominator


INPROPER FRACTIONS:

an inproper fraction has a numerator larger then the denominator.

like 7/4 or 3/2 or 7/3 or 16/15 or 15/15 or 100/5



Further shit #2:


Inproper fractions and mixed fractions are two sides to the same coin

to convert between the two divide the numerator by the denominataor

and then write down the (rounded) whole number answer and put your remainder over the original denominator.



Conversting mixed fractions to improper fractions


-Multiply the whole number part by the denominator

add it to the numerator

then write the result on top of the denominaor

Improper factions have the advantage of beeing better understood in serious equations but most people can only reconize mixed fractions in day to day life
